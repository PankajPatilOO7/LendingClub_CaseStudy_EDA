# Lending Club: EDA Case Study
Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

So the main aim of doing this case study is identify those customer which are likely to repay loan due to there financial problem or likely to get marked as 
charged off /defaulters.
